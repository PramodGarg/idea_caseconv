Case Conversion
===============

A plugin for JetBrain IDEs to convert between cases.

The plugin provides actions to convert to these cases:

- `snake_case`
- `dash-case`
- `camelCase`
- `PascalCase`
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- `UPPER CASE`
- `lower case`
- `fLIP cASE`

The Plugin was inspired by the [Case Conversion Plugin for SublimeText](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Case%20Conversion).
